May help lower cholesterol levels: Mustard oil is a good source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are believed to help lower LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol levels in the body. This may help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.  May have antibacterial and antifungal properties: Some research suggests that mustard oil may have antibacterial and antifungal properties, which may help protect against certain infections.  May promote hair and skin health: Mustard oil is commonly used topically for its potential benefits for hair and skin.
